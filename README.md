# Courses
These are classes I hope to make/teach at some point:

- [Courses](#courses)

## Subtitling
How to subtitle videos with Aegisub, and add those subtitles to the video. This would be a workshop, instead of a full course.
## Independent Broadcasting
Learn the technical aspects of streaming on a website like Twitch, YouTube, or TikTok! Requirements: A computer that meets OBS's recommended system requirements and an internet connection with at least a consistent 4Mbps upload speed, with 8Mbps upload highly recommended, as well as a headphones and a microphone, as well as a quiet environment to stream in. (the mic built into your headphones/earbuds is probably perfectly fine for this) Optionally, a capture card, webcam, or Live2D or similar can be used.

Classes would be streamed live to the public, since the whole point of the course is to teach how to do that exact thing. In-person students will get a chance to run the stream as I lecture, if they want to practice with a complex setup involving many scenes and sources and whatnot.

1. Installing OBS
2. Scenes and Sources
3. Audio
4. Resolution, Bitrate, Framerate and Latency
5. Dashboards
6. Overlays
7. Platform Rules/Guidelines
8. Copyright and DMCA notices

# Zero to Blog'o

3. Markdown and has 3x100 on Lighthouse!
   1. Why use Markdown?
      1. Markdown is a simpler abstraction for HTML. It lets you simply write content without worrying about the underlying tags and styling.
   2. Basics of Markdown
   3. Styling Markdown pages
   4. There is no "advanced markdown"
      1. Just keep in mind that if there's some functionality missing in Markdown, you can simply start using HTML within the document.
      2. Demonstrate the `<details>` tag and how you need a newline between tags and Markdown content if you want it to be styled.
   5. **Assignment:** Rewrite your blog posts in Markdown.
4. SSG and Eleventy
   1. What is a Static Site Generator (SSG) and why use one?
   2. Installing Node and Eleventy.
   3. Converting your blog/website into a template
   4. How to add new posts
   5. Eleventy features:
      1. Tags and Categories

   4. RSS feeds
   5. Google Search Console
6. Next Steps
   1. Learn programming!

## nand2tetris
Go from zeroes and ones to a general purpose computer that can run Tetris! This course would follow *The Elements of Computing Systems*, a textbook from MIT Press, almost to a T, with a few added units (in italics) to help set up development environments. An intro to computer science course using a high-level object-oriented language such as Java, JavaScript, Python, or C++ is required. Completing a course that includes topics like Algorithms and Data Structures, such as Harvard's freely available CS50, is highly recommended.

1. Setting up your development environment (Git, VSCode, Java)
2. Boolean Logic
3. Boolean Arithmetic
4. Memory
5. Machine Language
6. Computer Architecture
7. Assembler
8. Intro to Linux (optional)
9. Virtual Machine I: Processing
10. Virtual Machine II: Control
11. High-Level Language
12. Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
13. Compiler II: Code Generation
14. Operating System
15. More Fun to Go
16. Program Exchange: Debug your programs and virtual machines by exchanging them with other students!

## zero2video
Like nand2tetris, but for video. This one will take quite a while to put together.
